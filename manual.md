 You can choose to add it to your wishlist, follow the game to get notified when it receives updates or news, or ignore it to avoid seeing it on your front page. You can also see reviews for the product, games you own that it is similar to, and tags associated with it to find other similar games.

 By scrolling down and looking at the right side of the page you can see more game information. This includes controller support, if the game is multiplayer, and what languages it supports.

The Steam library page is where you can view all of your purchased games, manage them, and start them. To access the Library page, press the "Library" link on the top bar of Steam.

Here, you can see a list of all the games you own on the service. Games with a solid white title are installed on your PC, while games with a gray title are not currently installed. Clicking on a game shows you a page for it, allowing you to see information such as how many achievements you have, how long you've played it, and how much space it takes up on your PC. On games you haven't installed, a large blue button that says "Install" appears. To install the game on your pc, simply click on the button.

At the top of the library page list of games, there are several sorting options. The clock icon sorts your games by how recently you played them. The sideways triangle in a circle icon filters out all games that are not installed on your PC, only showing the games that are. Pressing the three lines icon brings up a more robust set of filtering options, such as only showing single player games or only showing games of a single genre.
