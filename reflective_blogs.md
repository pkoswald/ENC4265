# Wayback Analysis

Site Link: <https://web.archive.org/web/19991116095532/http://sonicfoundation.org/>

For this analysis, I looked at the website Sonic Foundation, a fan made webpage dedicated to the Sonic The Hedgehog franchise that was archived from 2000 to 2005.
The first thing I noticed was the general idea of an entire site dedicated to one community. Back then, it was more common to go to specific sites dedicated to a topic; instead of going to a Sonic community on a larger site, such as Reddit or Facebook, people would go to a site dedicated entirely to Sonic. I found it very enjoyable to go back and see a site like this dedicated entirely to one single series. I especially enjoyed looking back and seeing early reactions to games as they were announced and seeing all the theories people had about them.

Another big thing I noticed was how many different types of content a single site could cover back then. There are sections for news, fanart and writing, message boards, downloads for games and wallpapers, reviews, and more. It’s a very wide variety of content to have on a singular site, while nowadays most sites will focus on doing a few specific things. A modern site would have just the discussion forum, or just the news section instead of trying to include all of them in one place.
One of the more interesting aspects of the old internet I noticed here is the inclusion of a website guestbook, where users can document their visit to the site, along with where they’re from. It’s fascinating to see so many different users from so many different places logging in and documenting their thoughts. It’s not something I see on modern websites.

Overall, it was very interesting to look back at such an old site. It was obviously very different from a modern website, but in a way, it also made me miss some of what was lost. I enjoyed seeing such a niche, personalized site instead of just a slightly customized page conforming to the design of the larger site it’s on. Individual websites existed in a much larger way than they do now, where most activity online is consolidated to a few select sites.

# Reflective Blog 3

### Prompt : Explore an online tutorial, manual, or reference guide/FAQ page. Give it an honest but professional assessment. Describe in your post the aspects of the page(s) that are effective, and explain why. Describe the aspects of the page(s) that are ineffective, and explain why. Keep a professional tone, as though you expect the author(s) of the page(s) to read your post. 


I chose to explore the FAQ page on the [GameStop website](https://www.gamestop.com/faq/). One of the first issues I noticed is that the first two groups of questions answered were all related to the GameStop Pro reward account. This gives the feeling that the FAQ page is just an advertisement for the service, since it answers those questions instead of any related to problems the customer may have. I also feel that the FAQ is missing many questions that customers would want answered. For example, the FAQ doesn't have any information on cancelling or changing an order after it has been placed. One of the strengths of the page is that it goes over how to redeem each type of virtual currency card available at the store, which could be a common problem for customers since they all require different platforms or websites to redeem them. Overall, I think this FAQ page is not very good becuase it tries to focus too much on pushing the membership service to customers instead of answering important questions that are common among them, failing the many purpose of an FAQ page.

### Prompt : Use any generative AI to generate an assignment (or some other piece of writing) that you have already completed. Share the prompt you used, the results you received, and a brief analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the software.

For this reflective blog, I decided to use generative AI to generate Reflective Blog 3.

Prompt given: Write an assessment of the Gamestop FAQ page (https://www.gamestop.com/faq/), discussing what its strengths and weaknesses are and why those parts are effective or ineffective.

Generated response: "The GameStop FAQ page provides a thorough, organized explanation of services and policies, particularly focusing on its Pro Membership.

Strengths:

Clear organization: Topics like membership benefits, shipping, and returns are grouped logically, which makes navigation easy.
Detail-oriented: The page provides detailed explanations, especially about Pro membership rewards and their various benefits. This helps users understand the value of the membership.
Practical FAQs: Information like return windows, point expiration, and how to activate membership ensures customers can handle common issues without needing further assistance.

Weaknesses:

Overwhelming detail: For new users, the abundance of fine details (like exclusions and specific policies) might feel overwhelming or confusing.
Lack of visual aids: The page could benefit from visuals (charts or bullet points) to simplify complex information, such as benefit comparisons or eligibility for discounts.
Limited focus on general inquiries: The FAQ page is heavily biased toward membership-related questions, leaving a gap in addressing non-membership-related inquiries like product issues or troubleshooting.
Overall, while the page is effective in addressing specific membership queries, it could improve clarity for casual visitors by streamlining information and adding visuals."

My analysis: I find it interesting how the AI pointed out the bias on membership questions like I did when I wrote my reflective blog. One weakness I noted is that the AI recommended using visual aids, which are not typically used for FAQ pages. I also noticed that it claimed the page had "overwhelming detail" as a weakness, which I disagree with, while also listing the page being "detail-oriented" as a strength. It also said that the FAQ both provides information to "handle common issues" while also saying it had a "gap in addressing non-membership-related inquiries". This shows the contradictions that can occur in an AI generated assessment, as it listed something as being both the strength and weakness of the FAQ page.

# Reflective Blog 5

### Prompt: Use NotebookLM to analyze a manual from the web. Share a brief report describing your process, the manual, and your thoughts on the tool. What did it make easier for you? What was not easy? What do you think about the use of this AI for your future career?

I think the AI is more helpful for finding where in the manual to get information than for giving you the information. Most of the information it gave me when I asked it to summarize the important points was not very helpful. For example, the "Usage Instructions" it gave me didn't actually provide any instructions and instead listing information like not to fill the pan with oil. When I asked the AI to specifically tell me how to use the air fryer it still had issues, such as not saying to preheat the air fryer and to just put the ingredients into the basket.

However, there are some ways it can be useful. When I asked it how to air fry French fries, it directly gave me excerpts from the manual describing the time and temperature to cook different types of French fries. This shows how this type of AI can be helpful, because it can save time from looking through the whole manual to find out one specific piece of information. Overall, while it has its uses, I do not think I will be using this AI much in the future because I am experienced with how to search through a manual using Ctrl+F to find specific info, and the AI's helpfulness is limited by what it can find in the manual. If I ask it something that isn't already stated in the manual. For example, it didn't give me any particularly useful information when I asked how to make tater tots, which was not in the manual.

# Reflective Blog 6

### Prompt: After you have completed the Chatbot assignment or any assignment using AI for most of the work, reflect on your interaction with this emerging technology: What does AI do well? What does it not do well? What did you have to correct or re-prompt it to modify? What can you know about its training data? What kinds of data was included? What kinds of data was excluded? What do you think the future holds as this technology is used and further advanced?

One thing chatbots can do well is helping users access information in a more intuitive way. With a well-made chatbot, finding an answer is as easy as asking it a question and getting a specific response to your problem, which a lot of people consider better than having to search through a page for the one part that has the information they need. I had to give it a good amount of data to get it to that point however, including several summaries of the characters, plots, locations, and production background of the comic. For large scale projects, this amount of data may be unreasonable to create or obtain for the AI to get to a point where it needs to be.

One problem is the possibility of the information it gives the user being incorrect. While I was able to get my chatbot to give mostly accurate information after some trial and error, there were still some questions I asked where the answer it gave me wasn’t accurate. This is a problem because the AI is unable to say that it isn't certain about the answer, so it will parrot wrong information as though it is true. In customer service use, the chatbot may not be able to provide any answers to a user's question and instead redirect them to a human representative, which makes it useless.

Overall, while AI programs like chatbots can be a game changer, they aren't a one size fits all solution. They mostly work best in situations that don't require large amounts of data, such as customer support to solve the most common problems users face. It does not work as well for solving something that requires tons of information, such as a computer problem with many different causes and solutions.

### Prompt : Explore an online tutorial, manual, or reference guide/FAQ page. Give it an honest but professional assessment. Describe in your post the aspects of the page(s) that are effective, and explain why. Describe the aspects of the page(s) that are ineffective, and explain why. Keep a professional tone, as though you expect the author(s) of the page(s) to read your post. 

I chose to explore the FAQ page on the [Nintendo Switch website](https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/faq/). One immediate positive I noticed is how the page splits the FAQ into several sections, such as the different Nintendo Switch models, games and accessories, and the console's Online Service. It makes it much easier for the user to find the information they need. Another positive is that the information is laid out very clearly, with a list of questions separated into relevant sections with the answers given in a collapsible tab. It's a very simple but effective layout for finding important information.

One negative I noticed is that if the user can't find the information they need on the FAQ page, there's no immediately clear link to a support page where they would be able to get more help with their issue. Another negative is that some sections are noticeably smaller than others, to the point where it’s questionable why they're even included as a distinct section. The biggest example of this is the Nintendo Switch Online section, which consists of only one question. It makes the page even slightly more complicated for no reason.

The biggest negative is that the FAQ is geared towards people who have not yet purchased the system as opposed to people who already own the system and are having trouble with it. There are no questions related to resolving issues such as the console not turning on. Similarly to the GameStop FAQ page, it makes it feel a bit too much like an advertisement for the system instead of a page to help users.

Overall, while the FAQ page is pretty good for people who are interested in purchasing the system and want to know more specific details about it, it does little to help users who already own the system and want help with using it.
