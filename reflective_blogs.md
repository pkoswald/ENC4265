# Wayback Analysis

Site Link: <https://web.archive.org/web/19991116095532/http://sonicfoundation.org/>

For this analysis, I looked at the website Sonic Foundation, a fan made webpage dedicated to the Sonic The Hedgehog franchise that was archived from 2000 to 2005.
The first thing I noticed was the general idea of an entire site dedicated to one community. Back then, it was more common to go to specific sites dedicated to a topic; instead of going to a Sonic community on a larger site, such as Reddit or Facebook, people would go to a site dedicated entirely to Sonic. I found it very enjoyable to go back and see a site like this dedicated entirely to one single series. I especially enjoyed looking back and seeing early reactions to games as they were announced and seeing all the theories people had about them.

Another big thing I noticed was how many different types of content a single site could cover back then. There are sections for news, fanart and writing, message boards, downloads for games and wallpapers, reviews, and more. It’s a very wide variety of content to have on a singular site, while nowadays most sites will focus on doing a few specific things. A modern site would have just the discussion forum, or just the news section instead of trying to include all of them in one place.
One of the more interesting aspects of the old internet I noticed here is the inclusion of a website guestbook, where users can document their visit to the site, along with where they’re from. It’s fascinating to see so many different users from so many different places logging in and documenting their thoughts. It’s not something I see on modern websites.

Overall, it was very interesting to look back at such an old site. It was obviously very different from a modern website, but in a way, it also made me miss some of what was lost. I enjoyed seeing such a niche, personalized site instead of just a slightly customized page conforming to the design of the larger site it’s on. Individual websites existed in a much larger way than they do now, where most activity online is consolidated to a few select sites.

# Reflective Blog 3

### Prompt : Explore an online tutorial, manual, or reference guide/FAQ page. Give it an honest but professional assessment. Describe in your post the aspects of the page(s) that are effective, and explain why. Describe the aspects of the page(s) that are ineffective, and explain why. Keep a professional tone, as though you expect the author(s) of the page(s) to read your post. 


I chose to explore the FAQ page on the [GameStop website](https://www.gamestop.com/faq/). One of the first issues I noticed is that the first two groups of questions answered were all related to the GameStop Pro reward account. This gives the feeling that the FAQ page is just an advertisement for the service, since it answers those questions instead of any related to problems the customer may have. I also feel that the FAQ is missing many questions that customers would want answered. For example, the FAQ doesn't have any information on cancelling or changing an order after it has been placed. One of the strengths of the page is that it goes over how to redeem each type of virtual currency card available at the store, which could be a common problem for customers since they all require different platforms or websites to redeem them. Overall, I think this FAQ page is not very good becuase it tries to focus too much on pushing the membership service to customers instead of answering important questions that are common among them, failing the many purpose of an FAQ page.

# Reflective Blog 4

### Prompt : Use any generative AI to generate an assignment (or some other piece of writing) that you have already completed. Share the prompt you used, the results you received, and a brief analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the software.

For this reflective blog, I decided to use generative AI to generate Reflective Blog 2.

Prompt given: Write an assessment of the Gamestop FAQ page (https://www.gamestop.com/faq/), discussing what its strengths and weaknesses are and why those parts are effective or ineffective.

Generated response: The GameStop FAQ page provides a thorough, organized explanation of services and policies, particularly focusing on its Pro Membership.

Strengths:

Clear organization: Topics like membership benefits, shipping, and returns are grouped logically, which makes navigation easy.
Detail-oriented: The page provides detailed explanations, especially about Pro membership rewards and their various benefits. This helps users understand the value of the membership.
Practical FAQs: Information like return windows, point expiration, and how to activate membership ensures customers can handle common issues without needing further assistance.

Weaknesses:

Overwhelming detail: For new users, the abundance of fine details (like exclusions and specific policies) might feel overwhelming or confusing.
Lack of visual aids: The page could benefit from visuals (charts or bullet points) to simplify complex information, such as benefit comparisons or eligibility for discounts.
Limited focus on general inquiries: The FAQ page is heavily biased toward membership-related questions, leaving a gap in addressing non-membership-related inquiries like product issues or troubleshooting.
Overall, while the page is effective in addressing specific membership queries, it could improve clarity for casual visitors by streamlining information and adding visuals.
