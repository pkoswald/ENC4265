# Wayback Analysis

Site Link: <https://web.archive.org/web/19991116095532/http://sonicfoundation.org/>

For this analysis, I looked at the website Sonic Foundation, a fan made webpage dedicated to the Sonic The Hedgehog franchise that was archived from 2000 to 2005.
The first thing I noticed was the general idea of an entire site dedicated to one community. Back then, it was more common to go to specific sites dedicated to a topic; instead of going to a Sonic community on a larger site, such as Reddit or Facebook, people would go to a site dedicated entirely to Sonic. I found it very enjoyable to go back and see a site like this dedicated entirely to one single series. I especially enjoyed looking back and seeing early reactions to games as they were announced and seeing all the theories people had about them.

Another big thing I noticed was how many different types of content a single site could cover back then. There are sections for news, fanart and writing, message boards, downloads for games and wallpapers, reviews, and more. It’s a very wide variety of content to have on a singular site, while nowadays most sites will focus on doing a few specific things. A modern site would have just the discussion forum, or just the news section instead of trying to include all of them in one place.
One of the more interesting aspects of the old internet I noticed here is the inclusion of a website guestbook, where users can document their visit to the site, along with where they’re from. It’s fascinating to see so many different users from so many different places logging in and documenting their thoughts. It’s not something I see on modern websites.

Overall, it was very interesting to look back at such an old site. It was obviously very different from a modern website, but in a way, it also made me miss some of what was lost. I enjoyed seeing such a niche, personalized site instead of just a slightly customized page conforming to the design of the larger site it’s on. Individual websites existed in a much larger way than they do now, where most activity online is consolidated to a few select sites.
