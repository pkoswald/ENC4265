# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**  
**TO:** Mr. Jakobs
**FROM:** Arman Khoobehi
**SUBJECT:** Recomendations for Philips Airfryer XXL HD9656 Manual
**DATE:**  February 10, 2025

I evaluated the manual for the Philips Airfryer XXL HD9656 available at <https://www.philips.com.au/c-p/HD9656_93/premium-airfryer-xxl/support>


One strength I noticed right away is that the manual opens with a list of some of the most important saftey warnings, as well as a large note telling the user not to throw the manual away.
