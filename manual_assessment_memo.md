# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**  
**TO:** Mr. Jakobs  
**FROM:** Arman Khoobehi  
**SUBJECT:** Recomendations for Philips Airfryer XXL HD9656 Manual  
**DATE:**  February 10, 2025  

I evaluated the manual for the Philips Airfryer XXL HD9656 available at <https://www.philips.com.au/c-p/HD9656_93/premium-airfryer-xxl/support>


One strength I noticed right away is that the manual opens with a list of some of the most important saftey warnings and precautions, as well as a large note telling the user not to throw the manual away. These are both very useful pieces of information to have so it's good to put them right at the front of the manual, where they will definitely be seen. Another very good inclusion is the food table, which lists some of the most common types of food people use an airfryer for and information for how to cook them, such as the amount, time, temperature, and whether to turn or shake them halfway through cooking.

However, there are still some weaknesses in the manual. For one, while the opening list of warnings is a good idea, the contents of the list could be layed out more clearly. For example, it lists warngins for before setting up, using, and cleaning the product without an immediate indicator of when each warning is for.

Here are some of my ideas for improving the manual:
- Seperate the opening Important Safeguards list into sections, such as Before Use, During Use, and After Use.
- Second example
