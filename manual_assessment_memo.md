# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**  
**TO:** Mr. Jakobs  
**FROM:** Arman Khoobehi  
**SUBJECT:** Recomendations for Philips Airfryer XXL HD9656 Manual  
**DATE:**  February 10, 2025  

I evaluated the manual for the Philips Airfryer XXL HD9656 available at <https://www.philips.com.au/c-p/HD9656_93/premium-airfryer-xxl/support>


One strength I noticed right away is that the manual opens with a list of some of the most important safety warnings and precautions, as well as a large note telling the user not to throw the manual away. These are both very useful pieces of information to have so it's good to put them right at the front of the manual, where they will definitely be seen. Another very good inclusion is the food table, which lists some of the most common types of food people use an airfryer for and information for how to cook them, such as the amount, time, temperature, and whether to turn or shake them halfway through cooking.

However, there are still some weaknesses in the manual. For one, while the opening list of warnings is a good idea, the contents of the list could be laid out more clearly. For example, it lists warngins for before setting up, using, and cleaning the product without an immediate indicator of when in the use of the product each warning is for. Another weakness of the manual is the use of "Notes" in the "Using the appliance" section. While these can provide helpful information, the way they are just put in between the numbered steps makes them distracting and confusing from what the actual steps for using the airfryer are.

Here are some of my ideas for improving the manual:
- Separate the opening Important Safeguards list into sections, such as Before Use, During Use, and After Use.
- Move the information in the "Notes" into being part of the steps.

AI Statement: I used spellcheck in the writing of this assignment.
