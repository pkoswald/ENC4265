## About Me 
This is a paragraph about me. It explains my major at UCF, my career goals, and skills that I have. Even if I haven't worked anywhere that I would consider *in* the field that I'm majoring in, all work experience demonstrates that I can show up on time, communicate with supervisors, work with co-workers, etc. If you work in hospitality, you already work in a fast-paced environment! Retail? You've got great communication and customer service skills. Think about the things you do at work, and how those skills can be used in your dream job!
