# Welcome to Arman Khoobehi's Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
Hello, I am Arman Khoobehi. I am an Information Technology Major at the University of Central Florida. I am currently in my last semester before graduating. After graduating, I am hoping to start working in the industry later this year and eventually become a Systems Administrator. I have had experience providing tech support to my parents' business.
